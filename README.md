# iOS Take Home Excercise

Given a 'listing' endpoint to the reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), display a list of reddit listings with the thumbnail and title. This list should be able to be paginated. Clicking on one of the rows should take the user to a view with the comments for that listing.

Possible endpoints can be [hot, new, random, top] anything you like. An example URL would be http://www.reddit.com/r/all/new.json

implementation requirements
- use swift
- use automatic cell sizing and autolayout for the tableviewcell heights
- write the UI and constraints programmatically
- feel free to use cocoapods
